Trivia html idea: 
submit up to 3 questions - the more you submit, the more questions you will definitely get correct!

[form to submit questions](try first with one question)
"question"
answer a 
answer b 
answer c 
answer d 


---> take this data 
---> create sheet with all questions and options (release one at a time?)
- similar to the javascript interaction - but not in real-time? 
- create a password so bots can't create trivia questions? (or randos)

[form to submit answer]
-> reveal answer 

Keep track of points individually
- have them enter name or team name 
- create drop-down list of team names


- compile submittals - compare to correct answer
if correct_answer === selected_answer
- display correct answer
- display bar graphs of who selected which answer

Later:  
- point tracker 
- scrambling questions
- scrambling answers
